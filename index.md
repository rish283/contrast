<img style="float: left; padding-right:25px" src="assets/me.JPG" width="30%" height="30%">I am Rishabh Singh, a PhD candidate under the advisement of Dr. [Jose C. Principe](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/jose-c-principe/) at the [Computational NeuroEngineering Lab (CNEL)](http://www.cnel.ufl.edu), [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu).

My research work involves developing physics inspired operators in the RKHS for obtaining representations of data and neural network models that are useful for various applications in machine learning and signal processing that primarily include uncertainty quantification of neural networks, quantification of data/model transferability and time-series dependency quantification and clustering. Visit my [Research page](research.md) to learn more!

**Research Interests:** *Kernel methods, Information Theoretic Learning, Machine Learning, Physics inspired methods for interpreting data and neural networks.*

**Extra-curricular Interests:** *Outdoor runs, Soccer, Cooking, Global affairs.*

I am in the job market for research positions. Please reach out to me for opprtunities broadly related to (but not limited to) areas such as trusted/safe AI research, physics inspired AI, uncertainty in AI, representation learning, interpretable/explainable AI and robust AI research.
