<img style="float: left; padding-right:25px" src="assets/me.JPG" width="30%" height="30%">My name is Rishabh Singh. I'm a PhD candidate under the advisement of Dr. [Jose C. Principe](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/jose-c-principe/) at the [Computational NeuroEngineering Lab (CNEL)](http://www.cnel.ufl.edu), [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu).

My research work involves developing RKHS based methods that leverage certain concepts from quantum physics for obtaining useful representations of data and neural network models for applications such as uncertainty quantification in deep learning, quantification of data transferability and high resolution information retrieval from time-series data for clustering and dependency quantification.
