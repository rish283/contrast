RKHS based Physical Interpretation of Model Predictive Uncertainty
===

In this work, we combine the expressive power of the Gaussian RKHS and the accuracy of quantum physics to create a framework for quantifying the predictive uncertainty of a neural network model with significantly greater precision and speed than typical Bayesian approaches.
