<ins>RKHS BASED PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF MODEL UNCERTAINTY: THE QIPF</ins>
===

<img style="float: left; padding-right:25px" src="/fm3.JPG" width="50%" height="50%">

In this work, we combine the expressive power of the Gaussian RKHS and accuracy of quantum physics to create a framework, called the quantum information potential field (QIPF), for quantifying the predictive uncertainty of a neural network model. We show that the QIPF is significantly more precise, better calibrated and much faster than typical Bayesian approaches, especially in situations involving distributional shifts in the test-set.
