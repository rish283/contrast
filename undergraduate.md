I was a part of the 40 member FS (Formula Student) team of my college, Team Ojas, which built a single seat electric car for the international student competition, Formula Student (FS), held at the Silverstone circuit, UK. I was responsible for high voltage electrical systems of the vehicle. I along with two others were responsible for the high voltage electrical systems of the vehicle. Among other things, our role mostly included the following:-
<br />
- Deciding upon the appropriate motor ratings, type of motors, their quantity and configuration required according to the target performance parameters of the car.   
- Analysis of high power electric motor manufacturers and choosing the most appropriate one based on cost, reliability and performance.
- Appropriate calculation of battery power required in the event and configuration of cells to supply power to the motors.
- Analysis of high voltage battery pack and BMS (Battery Management System) manufacturers and choosing the most appropriate one based on cost and reliability.
