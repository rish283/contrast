I was a part of the 40 member FS (Formula Student) team of my college, Team Ojas, which built a single seat electric car for the international student competition, Formula Student (FS), held at the Silverstone circuit, UK. I was responsible for high voltage electrical systems of the vehicle. I along with two others were responsible for the high voltage electrical systems of the vehicle. Among other things, our role mostly included the following:-
<br />
- Deciding upon the appropriate motor ratings, type of motors, their quantity and configuration required according to the target performance parameters of the car.   
- Analysis of high power electric motor manufacturers and choosing the most appropriate one based on cost, reliability and performance.
- Appropriate calculation of battery power required in the event and configuration of cells to supply power to the motors.
- Analysis of high voltage battery pack and BMS (Battery Management System) manufacturers and choosing the most appropriate one based on cost and reliability.

During my junior and senior years, I was involved with two research projects involving electric machine systems (which was my interest at the time):

#Novel Rotor Position Estimation For Switched Reluctance Motor Using Vibration Signature Analysis

In this project, simulations were performed to demonstrate a novel rotor position estimation technique for switched reluctance motors where the vibration pulses being sensed on the stator frame was used as a signature to determine the rotor position. This removes the need for the conventionally used shaft position sensor inside the stator which involves additional costs and mechanical alignment problems.

#Dynamic braking of induction motor - Analysis of conventional methods and an efficient multistage braking model

A detailed analysis was made on capacitor self excitation and DC injection methods of dynamic braking of induction motor through MATLAB/SIMULINK simulations. These conventional dynamic braking methods were carefully analysed while changing various parameters.Using the data obtained from the analysis, the parameters of a fast and reliable multi-stage dynamic braking model were concluded for the best possible braking performance.
